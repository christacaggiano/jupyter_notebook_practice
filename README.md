# Jupyter Notebook Practice
This is a simple exercise to practice jupyter notebook. We will be reading in the file `Iris.csv` several different ways and looking at the data in the notebook. 

Assignment: 
- install the package `Seaborn` using `Anaconda` 
- read in the Iris dataset 
- Follow (this tutorial)[https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/seaborn-barplot/] to make a barplot visualizing the data using `Seaborn`. Ask yourself, what would be the important questions you could potentially answer with the available data? Make a few different variations. 
- Commit your jupyter notebook to GitHub.
